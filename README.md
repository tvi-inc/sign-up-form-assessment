### Objective

Using JavaScript and React, your assignment is to implement a responsive signup form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

The design team at TVI Inc has provided you with designs for a new signup form! To start, fork this repository, your fork will serve as your submission once you are done. Your task is to build out the project to the designs from the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. You'll want to put your solution in the `/solution` folder of your repository.

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using:
  - Language: **JavaScript**
  - Framework: **React**
- Your users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
    - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
- You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
- There is also a `style-guide.md` file, containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **JavaScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Submission

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you can email us a link to your repository stating that you are done!

All the best and happy coding,

The TVI Inc Team
